# Howdy!

I'm currently a Software Engineer at the PGA of America in Frisco, Texas, where I'm building software with Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, and React to support PGA members. For my personal projects, I'm mostly building apps in Ruby on Rails or Elixir and Phoenix.

## Contact Me

If you'd like to get in touch with me, the easiest way is to shoot me an email at [james@vanderburg.org](mailto:james@vanderburg.org)!
