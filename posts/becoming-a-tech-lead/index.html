<em class="prose md:prose-xl">March 4, 2024</em>

<article class="prose md:prose-xl py-4 max-w-none prose-a:text-blue-600 hover:prose-a:text-blue-800">
  <p>The <strong>tech lead</strong> role has been rather well-defined lately. Most people seem to
agree that being a tech lead requires an engineer to have a high level of
understanding and technical proficiency, to help remove blockers for the
engineering team, to write documentation, to mentor more junior engineers, and
to be able to make technical and architectural decisions to help move their team
forward. However, rather than adding to the number of blogs posts about what a
tech lead does, I'd like to talk about what you might experience when moving
into a tech lead role for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="new-responsibilities">New Responsibilities</h2>
<p>One of the things that nobody tells you about software engineering is how much
your job will fundamentally change as you progress from a junior engineer to a
senior engineer. I'm in my fifth full year as a software engineer, and I've just
taken on the responsibilities of a tech lead for a small team with three other
developers. In all honesty, it has been a difficult transition. As a junior
engineer (and as a mid-level engineer), the bulk of your responsibility is to
take <s>cups of coffee</s> tickets and turn them into working features. You are
fully integrated with the rest of your dev team. Even if you're not pairing with
them regularly, you are probably helping them out often by answering questions
and reviewing code.</p>
<p>When you start working as a tech lead, you will still be working as an
individual contributor, but it will be a much smaller fraction of your
day-to-day. You will be meeting with your product team much more frequently.
You'll probably be involved in regular meetings with stakeholders. You might
have regular meetings with other tech leads and engineering managers in your
organization. As a result, you won't spend as much time with the rest of your
engineering team. You'll feel more involved with your product team, <strong>and that's
okay.</strong> It will feel weird for a few weeks. Your main responsibility was writing
code. Now, you don't have only one main responsibility. You're expected to write
code, to write technical documentation, to be a mentor, to delegate tasks, and
more.</p>
<p>If you're joining me on this journey as a new tech lead, you're probably
thinking &quot;that's a lot of stuff!&quot; And it is! But if you have a good team and a
good manager supporting you, they'll know that it's going to take you some time
to adjust. It's a learning process.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge-point">The Challenge Point</h2>
<p>I really like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_point_framework">challenge point
framework</a>. At its
core, this learning framework asserts that you will learn the most when you are
properly challenged by the task that you're doing. You're trying to find the
&quot;Goldilocks&quot; level of difficulty. If the task is too easy, then you'll get bored
quickly and won't make much progress. If the task is too hard, you'll probably
get frustrated and give up, also limiting your progress. But if you find the
proper challenge point, the task's difficulty will be matched up properly with
your skill level and you'll make progress much more quickly.</p>
<p>Let's apply this to taking on the tech lead role. If everything comes naturally
and you can pick everything up from day one, then it's not enough of a
challenge. Your leaders probably waited too long to give you leadership
responsibilities. This hurts both you and them: you weren't growing your skills
as quickly as you could, and they were losing out on valuable time where you
could have been contributing to the team in a much larger way.</p>
<p>If you're completely overwhelmed and you constantly feel like you have no idea
what to do, then it's too much. Your leaders pulled the trigger too early. If
you can, try talking with other tech leads in your organization and asking for
help. If it's still too much, talk with your leaders and let them know what's
going on. (If you don't feel like that's an option, I'm sorry. Leaders should be
there to help you grow and succeed. Try and fix things if you can, but don't try
forever. Just remember: you can change your organization, or you can change your
organization.)</p>
<p>If your leaders hit the challenge point just right, then you'll probably feel
like you're in the &quot;too hard&quot; bucket for a little bit. You'll probably be taking
a few weeks to adjust. Try and take stock of where you are regularly. You can do
this through regular one-on-ones with your manager and by talking with other
tech leads and your team. Celebrate the small wins. You wrote your first big
technical document? Celebrate! You led a successful tech spike? <a href="https://media1.tenor.com/m/ufuTI1vDoUwAAAAC/treat-yo-self-treat-your-self.gif">Treat yo
self!</a>
You won't be able to do everything immediately, but you'll be adding new things
to your tech lead toolbox regularly.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>
<p>Becoming a great tech lead or senior engineer won't happen overnight.
Transitions like these are hard. I've been at it for six months, and I'm still
making mistakes and adding tools to that toolbox. Embrace the challenge and the
learning experiences and you'll be well on your way to success.</p>
