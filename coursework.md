# Coursework

Below is a listing of my relevant Computer Science coursework at Texas A&M in
reverse chronological order. Course descriptions are taken from the [Texas A&M
Undergraduate
Catalog.](http://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/computer-science/#coursestext)

## In Progress

### Computer and Network Security (CSCE 465)
Fundamental concepts and principles of computer security, operating system and
network security, secret key and public key cryptographic algorithms, hash
functions, authentication, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, IPSec and
VPN, wireless and web security.

### Computer-Human Interaction (CSCE 436)
Comprehensive study of the Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) area; includes
history and importance of CHI; CHI design theories; modeling of computer users
and interfaces; empirical techniques for task analysis and interface design;
styles of interaction and future directions of CHI including hypermedia and
computer-supported collaborative work.

### Senior Capstone Design (CSCE 482)
Project-based course to develop system integration skills for solving real-world
problems in computer science; significant team software project that integrates
advanced concepts across computer science specializations; projects require
design, implementation, documentation and demonstration, as well as design
methodology, management process and teamwork.

## Completed

### Artificial Intelligence (CSCE 420)
Fundamental concepts and techniques of intelligent systems; representation and
interpretation of knowledge on a computer; search strategies and control; active
research areas and applications such as notational systems, natural language
understanding, vision systems, planning algorithms, intelligent agents and expert
systems.

### Information Storage and Retrieval (CSCE 470)
Representation of, storage of and access to very large multimedia document
collections; fundamental data structures and algorithms of current information
storage and retrieval systems and relates various techniques to design and
evaluation of complete retrieval systems.

### Scripting Languages (Special Topics, CSCE 489)
This course is a study of a class of programming languages and tools known as
scripting languages. Topics include: writing scripts to control and connect
other programs, file, directory and database manipulation, extending scripting
languages to include new functionality, embedding functions of a scripting
language in other tools, and the syntax and usage of regular expressions.

### Software Engineering (CSCE 431)
Application of engineering approach to computer software design and development;
life cycle models, software requirements and specification; conceptual model
design; detailed design; validation and verification; design quality assurance;
software design/development environments and project management.

### Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CSCE 411)
Study of computer algorithms for numeric and non-numeric problems; design
paradigms; analysis of time and space requirements of algorithms; correctness of
algorithms; NP-completeness and undecidability of problems.

### Seminar (CSCE 481)
Investigation and report by students on topics of current interest in computer
science.

### Programming Studio (CSCE 315)
Intensive programming experience that integrates core concepts in Computer
Science and familiarizes with a variety of programming/development tools and
techniques; students work on 2 or 3 month-long projects each emphasizing a
different specialization within Computer Science; focuses on programming
techniques to ease code integration, reusability, and clarity.

### Introduction to Computer Systems (CSCE 313)
Introduction to system support for application programs, both on single node and
over network including OS application interface, inter-process communication,
introduction to system and network programming, and simple computer security
concepts; hands-on lab assignments.

### Programming Languages (CSCE 314)
Explores the design space of programming languages via an in-depth study of two
programming languages, one subject-oriented (Java), one functional (Haskell);
focuses on idiomatic uses of each language, and on features characteristic for
each language.

### Computer Organization (CSCE 312)
Introduction to computer systems from programmer's perspective including simple
logic design, data representation and processor architecture, programming of
processors, memory, control flow, input/output, and performance measurements;
hands-on lab assignments.

### Discrete Structures for Computing (CSCE 222)
Provide mathematical foundations from discrete mathematics for analyzing
computer algorithms, for both correctness and performance; introduction to
models of computation, including finite state machines and Turing machines.

### Data Structures and Algorithms (CSCE 221)
Specification and implementation of basic abstract data types and their
associated algorithms including stacks, queues, lists, sorting and selection,
searching, graphs, and hashing; performance tradeoffs of different
implementations and asymptotic analysis of running time and memory usage;
includes the execution of student programs written in C++.
