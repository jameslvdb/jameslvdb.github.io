# Fish Camp Online
[Fish Camp](https://www.tamu.edu/traditions/orientation/fish-camp/) is Texas
A&M's four-day extended orientation program that serves over 6,000 incoming
freshmen each year. This past year, over 2,500 students submitted counselor
applications. Previously, directors would spend several hours _each day_
manually preparing applications during the three week review period. They would
create PDFs every day by consolidating application and interview data into an
Access database, and they had to manually perform data validation. Fish Camp
needed a better way to review these applications.

Our solution, Fish Camp Online, is a Rails application with a lightweight HTML
and CSS frontend on top of a Postgres database. Our goal was to create a site
where the ~100 staff members can write interview transcripts, review
applications, and keep track of their preferred applicants with ratings from 1
to 10.
