### Capstone Project
- Spring 2019

At Texas A&M, all computer science students are required to take a [capstone course]({{ site.baseurl }}/coursework#senior-capstone-design-csce-482){:target="_ blank"}. For my project, I worked with my team to build an application to harness the power of large touchscreen displays to enhance the tabletop roleplaying game experience. We used Unity and a Perceptive Pixel display from Microsoft to build our application.

### Gaslight Team App
- Summer 2018  

[Gaslight](https://teamgaslight.com){:target="_ blank"} is a software consultancy in Cincinnati, Ohio. During my internship with them over the summer of 2018, I helped update their internal team app, which is a Rails application with a React frontend. I helped build a scheduler for the application, which is a responsive calendar to give employees greater visibility into Gaslightâ€™s ongoing projects and employee assignments. I participated in user story mapping, learned React on the job, wrote RESTful APIs, and built ActiveRecord and ActiveModel objects to create the scheduler. I also performed ActiveRecord query optimization, collaborated with a designer, and pair programmed with other interns daily.

The scheduler shows engagements and assignments on a four- or twelve-week basis (in addition to showing one week in the past). Assignments are shown/hidden underneath each project by clicking on the engagement's bar. Previous and future engagements can also be shown by using the weekly navigation buttons in the top right corner. Below is a screenshot of the scheduler showing the "Bench" engagement expanded (assignments here represent a lack of assignment elsewhere for a given week). Employees can be added to an engagement using the **+** button, and the engagement itself can be edited with the notepad button.

### eCampus Redesign
- April 2019

During my final year at Texas A&M, I got much more interested in front-end development and usability. In the spring of 2019, I took [Computer-Human Interaction]({{ site.baseurl }}/coursework/#computer-human-interaction-csce-436) to learn more. One assignment during the semester was designing a mockup for a solution to a usability problem that we had observed. We chose to look at eCampus, Texas A&M's learning management system. It has its share of issues, but we focused on consolidating data and reducing the number of clicks required to access information. I used React to quickly build a single-page app as an example of what a simpler homepage would look like.

### Dungeons & Dragons
- Ongoing

I picked up Dungeons & Dragons while I was in college. I found that flipping through the books during a game was rather tedious, and I wanted to have some sort of application that would let me quickly reference different rules and material. I found that no existing tools quite fit my needs, but the data I needed was readily available, so I created a Rails app from scratch and started building. This is a major exercise in iterative design and data modeling. Some things in D&D can be modeled consistently. Weapons have all the same attributes. Spells are a little less consistent. But descriptions for monsters are inconsistent and open-ended. This is a project that is continually evolving. I don't feel quite ready to show off the source code yet, but I am more that willing to discuss it!

### Fish Camp Online
- Spring 2018  

[Fish Camp](https://www.tamu.edu/traditions/orientation/fish-camp/){:target="_ blank"} is Texas A&M's four-day extended orientation program that serves over 6,000 incoming freshmen each year. This past year, over 2,500 students submitted counselor applications. Previously, directors would spend several hours _each day_ manually preparing applications during the three week review period. They would create PDFs every day by consolidating application and interview data into an Access database, and they had to manually perform data validation. Fish Camp needed a better way to review these applications.

Our solution, Fish Camp Online, is a Rails application with a lightweight HTML and CSS frontend on top of a Postgres database. Our goal was to create a site where the ~100 staff members can write interview transcripts, review applications, and keep track of their preferred applicants with a rating system.
