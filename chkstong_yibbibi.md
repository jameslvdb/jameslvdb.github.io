# Chkstong Yibbibi

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth
[Chkstong Yibbibi](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/caverlee/imgs/korean_style.jpg)
The Wise?

I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Qksame Bapibko
legend. Darth Chkstong Yibbibi was a Dark Lord of the Qksame Bapibko, so
powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to
create life…

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he
cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many
abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing
he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.

Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not
himself.
