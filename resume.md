## Experience

### PGA of America

Frisco, TX  
November 2021---Present

### USAA

Plano, TX  
September 2019---October 2021

- Worked with USAA’s Enterprise Content Management and Generation team to
  support all member-facing operational communications.
- Used Spring Boot (both Spring MVC and Spring Webflux), Kafka, SQL databases,
  and Cassandra to build a mass com- munications service to reach all of USAA’s
  membership within an hour, replacing a legacy service that would tie up
  production support and developer time.
- As a junior developer, led development and design of a React frontend for our
  mass communications service. Used React, Redux, and Jest to build the frontend
  for users to schedule, send, and track the status of mass communication jobs.
  My efforts on error reporting helped eliminate the need for developers to
  perform lengthy manual reconciliation of messages that encountered errors
  during processing.
- Increased my team’s testing and quality assurance proficiency. Used Cypress to
  automate end-to-end testing for our mass communications service. Also
  practiced and promoted test-driven development, and learned Groovy and Spock
  to enable better testing of Spring Boot microservices.
- Won Honorable Mention for an internal USAA hackathon. Wrote a small amount of
  Go tests for a project with the goal of implementing externalized
  configuration with Spring Cloud Config that would be able to work with USAA’s
  infrastructure.
- Converted a microservice in our mass communications system from Spring Webflux
  to Spring MVC.

### Launch Scout

Cincinnati, OH  
May 2018---August 2018

- Built a scheduler single-page app for Launch Scout’s internal team
  application, using React and Rails to create a responsive calendar to give
  employees greater visibility into Launch Scout’s ongoing projects and employee
  assignments.
- Participated in user story mapping, learned React on the job, wrote RESTful
APIs, and built ActiveRecord and Active Model objects to create the scheduler.
Performed ActiveRecord query optimization, collaborated with a designer, and
pair programmed with other interns daily.
