This was a solid round for my short game. The tee shots were atrocious (hence
zero greens in regulation), but I had several solid recovery shots that led to
one-putts. Overall, I'm happy with this round as a starting point. I have a
clear area of focus and I had a lot of good shots. On to the next!
