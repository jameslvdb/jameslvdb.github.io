Howdy, everyone. Starting a career in software engineering is an interesting 
journey. Many of you have probably seen the "A Day in My Life as a Software 
Engineer" videos from engineers at Amazon or Google, and I think it gives a 
bit of a warped perspective on what your early career will look like.

Some background on me: I'm 26 years old (at time of writing) and I'm in the
fifth year of my career as a software engineer. I'm a full-stack developer
working in Ruby on Rails and React. 

## From Student to Employee

One of the most important revelations I have had in my career was when I figured
out the difference between school and work. Many thanks to [Ken
Kousen](https://www.kousenit.com/) for articulating this in his book [_Help Your
Boss Help You_](https://pragprog.com/titles/kkmanage/help-your-boss-help-you/).
It's a short read and is packed with great information for young professionals,
but none have helped me more than this one. 

### The Game of School

When you're in school, your teachers (if they're good ones) all have the same
goal: teaching you the course material. This is especially clear in grade
school. Funding for the school is often tied to standardized testing results. If
the school as a whole performs poorly, the school's funding could be reduced. Is
this logic backwards? Does it have the potential to create a downward spiral on
poorly-funded and under-performing schools? Yeah! But it's the reality of the
system: teachers and school administrators have a financial incentive to "teach
to the test."

Knowing this, it's easy to figure out why teachers ask their students questions.
Teachers need to make sure that you, the student, know the correct answer.
They're quizzing you. As students, we learn over years of schooling not only how
to find the answer, but also to show how you got to your answer. Partial credit
for showing your work incentivizes students to give long, verbose answers. Many
students figure out how this system works, and we end up getting really good at
**the game of school.**

### The Game of Work

In the corporate world, the game of school no longer applies. Let's say your
manager comes to you and asks "Hey, do you know how to add a new view to our
database schema?" If you haven't used views before, you might not know how to
answer at all. If you have a basic understanding, you might try to come up with
an answer that might earn you half points on a SQL pop quiz. 

The secret that completely changed my perspective on questions from my manager
is that if someone in the office asks you a question, it's because they **don't
know the answer.**

If you don't actually know, the answer your manager is looking for is "no".

The better form of this answer is "no, but I'll find out."

You'll often get questions from managers or PMs asking about the status of a
ticket or story. For a long time, I heard this kind of question and thought it
was a slightly passive-aggressive way of telling me "Hey! Hurry up!" More often
than not, the question is asked because they **don't know the answer**. If the
status of the ticket is continuously updated in your team's project management
system (Jira, Trello, etc.), then they wouldn't need to ask.
