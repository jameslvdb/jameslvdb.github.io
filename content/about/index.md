# About Me

I'm **James Vanderburg.** I currently work for the [PGA of America](https://www.pga.com)
as a software engineer and a tech lead. I help build the PGA Coach and MyPGA
apps, which support the golf coaching businesses of PGA Professionals nationwide.
I primarily write software with Ruby on Rails and React, although Elixir has
been occupying much of my tinkering lately.

Prior to the PGA, I spent two years at [USAA](https://usaa.com) building Spring
Boot microservices as a part of their operational messaging organization. I
helped build large reactive systems to reach USAA's millions of members quickly.
I also graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in Computer Science,
and spent a summer with the wonderful folks at [Launch Scout](https://launchscout.com)
as an intern.
