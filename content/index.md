# Howdy!

I'm James! I'm a software engineer and tech lead at the [PGA of
America](https://www.pga.com), where I'm using Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, and React
to build coaching tools for PGA Professionals. I love reading, music, golfing
([badly](golf-at-the-swing)), trying new barbecue, and cheering on my favorite
sports teams.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, the easiest way is to shoot me an email at [james@vanderburg.org](mailto:james@vanderburg.org)!
